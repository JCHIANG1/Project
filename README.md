# Introductory Python Project to design an ATM
This project is to apply my knowledge of Object-oriented programming in Python, I designed an ATM class that will be used to provide the functionality required to perform banking oporations. On the other hand, the main module of the program offers users the ability to log into an account and perform the banking oporations.
