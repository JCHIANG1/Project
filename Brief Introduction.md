# Hello...
I'm new to programming and passionate in it:)<br>Coding is fun to me, it's like learning a new language and solving puzzles!<br>To improve my technical skills I plan to combine what I learned in class and create small projects here.

# The ATM project
This project is to apply my knowledge of Object-oriented programming in Python, I designed an ATM class that will be used to provide the functionality required to perform banking oporations. On the other hand, the main module of the program offers users the ability to log into an account and perform the banking oporations.
