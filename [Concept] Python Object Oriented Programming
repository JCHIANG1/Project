    def __init__(self,n,o):
        self.name=n
        self.occupation=o
     
    #define 2 methods
    def do_work(self):
        if self.occupation == "tennis player":
            print(self.name,"plays tennis")
        elif self.occupation == "actor":
            print(self.name,"shoots film")
      
    def speaks(self):
        print(self.name,"says how are you?")
    
 #create an instance
 tom = Human("tom cruise","actor") #by doing Human() we initializing the first init method
 tom.do_work()
 tom.speaks()
