--what is a class?
1) the concept of class can apply to other programming language not just for python
2) Properties and Methods form a class entity, for example under HUMAN class the properties may be name, gender and occupation,
and the Methods may be speak and talk

--what is an object?
object is the specific instance of class, for example the object of the HUMAN class may be Tom or Mary

--what is the method?
method can only be called by the object

class Human:
    
    #define 1 method that has 2 properties (attributes)
    def __init__(self,n,o):
        #define the attributes
        self.name=n
        self.occupation=o
     
    #define 2 methods
    def do_work(self):
        if self.occupation == "tennis player":
            print(self.name,"plays tennis")
        elif self.occupation == "actor":
            print(self.name,"shoots film")
      
    def speaks(self):
        print(self.name,"says how are you?")
    
 #create an instance of class Human
 tom = Human("tom cruise","actor") #by doing Human() we initializing the first init method
 tom.do_work()
 tom.speaks()
 
 #we can access the attributes of the object
 print(tom.name)
 print(tom.occupation)
